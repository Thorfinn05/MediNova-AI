## 🧠 How MediNova Works

MediNova is powered by *Gemini 2.0 Flash* agents that work together in a modular pipeline to:

1. Analyze symptoms
2. Recommend tests
3. Suggest treatments
4. Annotate medical images
5. Deliver secure, explainable outputs

Each agent specializes in a task but collaborates with others for holistic analysis.
